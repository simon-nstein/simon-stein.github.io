        <p class="header">Timeline & My Role</p>
        <ul>
            <li>September 2023 - Present</li>
            <li>In development...</li>
            <li>Solo project</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="header">Opportunity Hypothesis</p>
        <p>I was originally fascinated with how simple but engaging of a game Wordle is. Even though we usually solved the puzzles by ourselves, my friends and I would regularly talk about that day's game.</p>
        <p>pollthru was founded to create an engaging platform that empowers people to connect, compete, and have fun while collectively uncovering societal trends and preferences, enhancing their intuition and critical thinking in a friendly and thought-provoking environment.</p>

        <p class="header-part">Part 1: Discovery</p>
        <p class="header">Personas</p>
        <p>Incorporating personas has been a helpful tool to better understand our customers and enhancing our product's user experience. By doing so, we have a deeper understanding of their priorities and desires, enabling us to create a product that truly aligns with their needs and behaviors.</p>
        <img class="header-image" src="images/pollthru-personas.jpg">

        <p class="header">User Interviews</p>
        <p>To gain deeper insights into my target audience, I conducted user interviews. These interviews allowed me to connect with individuals I believed closely resembled our target personas. The primary goals were to assess their interest in the app and to understand their current mobile gaming habits, helping me refine our product based on their feedback.</p>
        <p>Insights:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="li-bold">Incorporate competitive elements to motivate users.</span>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>“I enjoy games and quizzes that challenge my critical thinking and problem-solving skills”</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><span class="li-bold">Provide a variety of challenging tasks to keep users engaged, entertained, and encourage regular participation.</span>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>“I like having a daily challenge to take on, like Wordle does, where it's quick but still a fun challenge. It's always a fun way to start my day or when I'm bored to challenge myself”</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><span class="li-bold">Facilitate social interaction and allow users to connect with friends and compete with each other.</span>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>“My friends and I are always super competitive and love challenging each other at games. Weather it's playing Fifa, TriviaCrack at lunch, or playing ping pong, we always try to outperform each other”</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><span class="li-bold">People would enjoy the idea that their input would go towards the game and also guessing what others put.</span>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>“I love the idea of being able to provide my own input and see if others can guess it. It's like a fun challenge where I get to be creative and see how well others know me."</li>
                    <li>"Guessing other users' input is a great way to test my knowledge and intuition. It challenges me to think outside the box and consider different possibilities. It's a unique feature that sets this app apart."</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="header">Environmental Scan</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="li-bold">What's out there</span>
            <ul>
                <li>I analyzed four popular web and mobile applications centered around daily puzzles and challenges with friends.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img class="header-image" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 55%;" src="images/scan.jpg">

        <ul>
            <li><span class="li-bold">How we're similar:</span>
                <ul><li>Like these apps, we offer daily challenges that incentivize users to return regularly. Our game is designed to be quick, ensuring it can be enjoyed in a short burst of time. Additionally, we provide features that allow users to share their responses and answers with friends, fostering social interaction and competition.</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li><span class="li-bold">What sets us apart:</span>
                <ul><li>What distinguishes our app from the others is our unique approach to incorporating crowdsourcing and user opinions in shaping the challenges. I found that none of these popular apps had elements of crowdsourcing and incorporating users' opinions towards the challenges. Unlike the competition, our app places a strong emphasis on involving users towards the challenges, which presents an exciting opportunity for innovation and engagement.</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li><span class="li-bold">Why we fit:</span>
                <ul><li>We provide a unique and engaging approach to solving daily puzzles and challenges with friends. Our mix of user involvement, daily challenges, quick gameplay, and social sharing sets us up as a compelling competitor in this space. By actively involving users in shaping the challenges, we tap into a desire for community-driven experiences that the other apps lack. This user-centric approach not only makes our app stand out but also positions it as a platform where users feel a deeper connection and ownership, ultimately fostering long-term engagement and loyalty.</li></ul>

        <p class="header-part">Part 2: Wireframes and Iterations</p>
        <img class="header-image" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 55%;" src="images/wireframe.png">
        <p class="header">Iterations</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="li-bold">Removal of Weekend Challenge and Points System:</span>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><span class="li-bold">Problem:</span> In our initial design, users' primary objective was to unlock a weekend challenge, with the potential to earn money if they won. Unlocking this challenge was contingent upon correctly guessing the answer in the daily challenge for a set number of days each week. Specifically, users needed to make accurate guesses on 3 out of 5 days to qualify for the weekend challenge. However, during user testing, we noticed that both the Weekend Challenge and the points system introduced confusion and detracted from the intended simplicity of the game. Additionally, users who joined the game later in the week had no opportunity to participate in the forthcoming weekend challenge, leading to reduced user engagement.</li>
                    <li><span class="li-bold">Solution: </span>As a result, we decided to eliminate these features, focusing on a streamlined day-to-day gameplay experience.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><span class="li-bold">Introduction of a Popup for Guessing Challenge and Poll:</span>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><span class="li-bold">Problem: </span>User feedback revealed occasional confusion among our users regarding the daily challenge and daily poll, making it challenging for them to distinguish between the two elements and what each of their functions were.</li>
                    <li><span class="li-bold">Solution: </span>In response to this issue, we drew inspiration from competitors in the same industry and implemented a Popup. This popup effectively distinguishes between the daily challenge and daily poll, thereby enhancing user comprehension and overall usability.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><span class="li-bold">Inclusion of a Stats Section and Share Buttons to Boost User Engagement:</span>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><span class="li-bold">Problem:</span>Users expressed a desire to compete with friends and improve their personal best scores within the app. However, the absence of features to support this led to a lack of motivation and reduced user engagement.</li>
                    <li><span class="li-bold">Soltuion: </span>To address this issue and boost user engagement, we introduced a stats section and button that let users share their results with friends. This new feature offers users a clear and enticing way to track their progress, beat their own records, and compete with friends, ultimately fostering a more competitive and engaging environment within the app.</li>

        <p class="header-part">Part 3: High-Fidelity Prototype & Iterations</p>
        <img class="header-image" src="images/prototype.png">
        <p>An aspect of the app we realized was hindering the experience was that the login feature caused a slowdown for users. The app relied on quick interactions, and the additional login step seemed to discourage users from diving right in. This realization prompted me to take a different approach. Instead of relying on Google authentication, I decided to implement localStorage, a solution that stores user data on their browser via cookies. This change not only eliminated the need for Google login but also significantly improved the user experience, making it more inviting and quicker to get started.</p>

        <p class="header-part">Part 4: Development</p>
        <p class="dev-p">In the previous parts, I shared the initial concept and design phases of this project. Now, let's dive into the exciting realm of development, where all the pieces come together to bring an idea to life.</p>
        
        <p class="dev-header">React</p>
        <p class="dev-p">As I embarked on the development phase, one thing became clear from the outset: this project was going to be a learning experience, especially when it came to using React. It was my first time working with this JavaScript library, and I was eager to explore its capabilities. I dove into React's documentation and numerous online tutorials to get a grasp of its fundamentals.</p>

        <p class="dev-header">localStorage</p>
        <p class="dev-p">As discussed in 'PART 3: High-Fidelity Prototype & Iterations,' I made the decision to bypass Google Auth for the storage of user data and instead chose a localStorage solution. This approach worked out exceptionally well and was straightforward to implement, thanks to well-explained documentation.</p>

        <p class="dev-header">Firestore</p>
        <p class="dev-p">Although I did not push any user data to Firestore, opting to use localStorage instead, I still needed a way to retrieve the daily questions that users would be seeing. I saw this as an opportunity to learn how to work with React and Firestore. Therefore, I utilized Firestore to fetch the questions that the user would encounter. By manipulating the 'rules', I enabled non-authenticated users to read the data, allowing them to access the questions.</p>

        <p class="dev-header">Frontend Development</p>
        <p class="dev-p">Frontend Development While React and Firestore proved to be powerful tools, the frontend development phase did present some challenges. Although I was not new to frontend development, I still had room to grow. The most significant challenge I faced was building the circular slider, a key element for the app's functionality.</p>
        <p class="dev-p">Implementing a normal slider in React may be relatively straightforward, but a circular one posed a different challenge. After tackling some tricky geometry, algebra, and learning about strokeDashoffset and strokeDasharray for paths in JavaScript, I successfully implemented exactly what I had envisioned.</p>
