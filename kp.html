            <p class="title">Digital Engineering Internship at Kaiser Perminente</p>
            <p>This past summer, I had the opportunity to work at Kaiser Permanente, a healthcare provider I've been a member of for over 20 years. Having been on the user end for most of my life, I finally had the chance to dive into the intricacies behind the scenes.</p>
            <p>My focus was on Kaiser Permanente's Digital group, specifically within the Data & AI Platform Engineering team. I contributed to the DevOps and Consumer Data Platform teams, assisting in tasks related to cloud database maintenance, monitoring, and reporting to fulfill Kaiser Permanente's business objectives.</p>
            <p>I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to be part of a mission-driven organization like Kaiser Permanente. Knowing that my work was helping to further their healthcare mission and positively impact people's lives was immensely rewarding.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately due to NDA I can't show my work, but please do hesitate to contact me to discuss my experience!</p>
